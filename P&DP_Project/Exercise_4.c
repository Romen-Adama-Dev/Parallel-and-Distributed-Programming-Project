/**
 * 4ยบ Exercise
 * Euler gamma constant is defined as the limit of a sequence gn.
 * Write a concurrent program that calculates gn, with the following assumptions: 
 * - N - the number of elements of the sum is loaded from the keyboard 
 * - P - number of processes, which will compute the sum is a constant in a program
 * Each process calculate his own fragment of the sum - for example, for n = 100, p = 10,
 * the first process computes elements 1 to 10, the second from 11 to 20, etc.,
 * at the end the partial sums are added and logarithm is subtracted.
 *  Note: n may not be divisible by p. The program can be made using any familliar technique .
