/**
 * 3ยบ Exercise
 * Write a program that calculates the value of the expression using the Mclaurin series.
 * Compare the obtained value with the value from the math library. Measure the time of
 * execution of the program for the different number of threads.
 * The program should be made with the use of MPI or Pthreads.
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * The Maclaurin series is a template that allows you to express many other functions as power series.
 * It is the source of formulas for expressing both sin x and cos x as infinite series.
